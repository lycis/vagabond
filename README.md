# Vagabond
Vagabond is a framework that builds onto the foundation of Vagrant. 
It allows to define sets of operating systems and features that make it
easier to define virtual machines. Also the complex configuration of
Vagrant is hidden within a specific DSL that simplifies the definition
of machines, features and operating systems.

## Requirements
To use Vagabond you will need to have the following dependencies installed:

* Vagrant (version>=1.7.2)

## Quickstart
To directly jump to using Vagabond just clone this repository into the 
folder that will hold your Vagrant machines. Then just adapt the `.conf`
files that are in the folder `vagabond/conf`.
